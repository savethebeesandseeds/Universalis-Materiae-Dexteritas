# Native Atari container contract

The user requested a GPU container and then directed the implementation to use
C/C++ instead of Python. This native contract supersedes the unbuilt Python
proposal. Creation follows this document and `atari.ps1`.

The initial never-started container encountered a conflict on port 43118.
The user approved replacing that exact container on port 43260 while preserving
its image and bind-mounted data. The table records the corrected configuration;
see [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) for the original inspection and recovery record.

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Container | `atari-dev` |
| Image | `atari:dev` |
| Base | `debian:12-slim@sha256:88200866dfff7ea7f5cbcb6ec7c8a701889efe6fe859fe64d6990e4b07ea4171` |
| Command | `sh /workspace/run.sh` |
| Application | `/workspace/build/native/atari serve --root /workspace --rom /opt/ale/roms/pong.bin --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080` |
| Working directory | `/workspace` |
| Bind | `C:\Work\Universalis-Materiae-Dexteritas\projects\atari` to `/workspace`, read-write |
| Named volumes | None |
| Port | `127.0.0.1:43260` to `8080/tcp` |
| Restart | `unless-stopped` |
| GPU | `--gpus all`, NVIDIA compute and utility capabilities |
| Other devices | None |
| Init/shared memory/stop timeout | Enabled / 1 GiB / 30 seconds |
| Labels | `io.waajacu.managed=true`, `io.waajacu.project=atari`, `io.waajacu.config=native-v1` |

`setup.sh` installs native dependencies only, accepts no operation arguments,
and uses `--no-install-recommends` for APT. Native archives have pinned hashes
in `dependencies.lock`. Python is neither installed nor used to build, run,
learn, evaluate, or serve the application.

`run.sh` builds the project and starts the native viewer. `atari.ps1` inspects
and reuses an exact matching container, starting a stopped one by immutable ID.
A conflict is preserved. No command deletes containers, images, volumes,
caches, or experiments. Runs and checkpoints stay on the host bind mount.
